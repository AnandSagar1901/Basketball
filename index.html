        <h3>What is Basketball?</h3>
        <p>Basketball is essientally soccer except that you dribble with your hands and you score by making shots.</p>
        <h3>How do you play Basketball?</h3>
        <p>Each team has 12 players. 5 players play at a time. If a player fouls another player there is a penalty. This penalty may vary based on when and what the foul was. For example if someone fouls another player while they're shooting it is a shooting foul. The player who got fouled gets 2 freethrows, each one worth one point(A normal shot is 2  points and if it is outside the three point line it's three points)
            If a player does 5 or 6 fouls they are ejected from the game.
            The game is split into 4 quarters. Each quarter 12 minutes. So one game is  48 minutes. At the beginning of each game 1 player from each team goes to the half court line for the jump-ball. The ref throws the ball in the air and the objective of the players to knock the ball back towards his or her's teamates.
